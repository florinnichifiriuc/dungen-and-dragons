# Strategic Sync – Condition Timer Transparency Initiative
- **Date:** 2025-10-28 09:30 UTC
- **Attendees & Roles:**
  - Product Owner – reviews delivery roadmap and player value
  - Software Architect – validates technical direction and scalability
  - UI Designer – assesses usability and visual cohesion
  - D&D Experience Lead – ensures mechanics feel authentic and table-ready

## Pre-Meeting Audit
- Reviewed `PROGRESS_LOG.md`, recent task notes (Tasks 30–37), and the dashboard prototypes to confirm timer creation, countdown automation, alerts, filters, and quick adjust/clear flows are implemented with realtime broadcasting.
- Confirmed README reflects core platform pillars but noted it lacks guidance on the upcoming projection layer and player-facing transparency work.
- Identified that Task 38–41 briefs exist but require clearer success criteria, privacy guidelines, and UX acceptance details before sprint planning.

## Agenda
1. Celebrate progress across the token condition timer roadmap
2. Evaluate architecture and UX readiness for the remaining backlog
3. Identify gaps for player-facing visibility and DM workflow polish
4. Align on next sprint scope, documentation updates, and cross-discipline assets (wireframes, narrative copy deck)

## Highlights of Completed Work
- Condition timer ecosystem (presets, timers, countdown automation, alerts, dashboards, quick adjust/clear, and filters) is fully shipped and covered with Pest/Dusk suites, aligning with the Week 3 roadmap.
- Realtime collaboration via Laravel Reverb continues to provide stable synchronization for map tokens, condition badges, and dashboard updates.
- Supporting infrastructure—AI narration, search, exports, accessibility, and localization—remains healthy, enabling downstream features to stay cohesive with campaign management flows.
- Existing condition copy and iconography already map to core spell effects, giving us a narrative baseline for player-safe summaries.

## Perspective Reviews
### Product Owner
- Value delivery for GMs is strong; timers, alerts, and dashboards reduce bookkeeping friction during encounters.
- Player-facing transparency is still missing; upcoming backlog items should prioritize safe redaction and narrative-friendly summaries to keep immersion high without leaking GM-only intel.
- Recommend bundling remaining timer work with session recap/reporting touchpoints to amplify cross-feature value.
- Call out need for a player trust metric in research sessions once summaries launch to validate immersion impact.

### Software Architect
- Current timer services reuse turn scheduler queues and broadcasting channels effectively; no architectural blockers for batch adjustments or player summaries.
- Need to extend validation/form request coverage for multi-select timer operations and ensure optimistic updates reconcile correctly with server truth to avoid race conditions.
- Suggest introducing a read-model projection (cached JSON payload) for player summaries to keep payloads lightweight and privacy-aware.
- Flagged requirement to document projection invalidation hooks and failure logging so Ops can monitor desync scenarios.

### UI Designer
- Dashboard interactions are consistent with the existing shadcn/ui toolkit, but bulk adjustment flows require additional affordances (selection states, confirmation banners, mobile gestures).
- Player summary surfaces should mirror existing recap cards, leveraging Tailwind typography scales for narrative beats and iconography for urgency.
- Recommend documenting responsive breakpoints for new modals/sidebars introduced by batch operations.
- Identified need for dedicated wireframes covering desktop, tablet, and mobile experiences before implementation kicks off.

### D&D Experience Lead
- Current mechanics align with tabletop cadence—automated countdowns mirror initiative rounds while preserving GM authority.
- Bulk adjustments must support common spell effects (e.g., Bless, Bane) that impact multiple tokens simultaneously; presets should allow shared duration tweaks without repetitive input.
- Player summaries should translate mechanical statuses into in-world fiction ("Arcane winds falter around you in 1 round") to maintain immersion.
- Request collaboration with narrative writer to seed 12–15 reusable snippets keyed to conditions and urgency tiers.

## Decisions
- Proceed with Task 38 focusing on multi-select UX and backend safeguards before exposing player summaries.
- Split player-facing work into two phases: narrative summary delivery (existing Task 39) and a follow-up task for mobile-first recap widgets.
- Capture architectural patterns for reusable timer projections within developer documentation once implemented.
- Update README and AGENTS guidance to reflect projection expectations and narrative alignment guardrails.

## Action Items
1. **Product Owner:** Update task plan backlog to reflect phased player transparency strategy and note dependencies on timer projection service.
2. **Software Architect:** Define data contract for batch adjustment API and projection caching layer prior to implementation (document in upcoming task notes).
3. **UI Designer:** Draft wireframes for multi-select adjustments and player summary cards, aligning with existing Inertia layout conventions.
4. **D&D Experience Lead:** Curate list of common condition narratives to seed player summaries and QA the copy during implementation.
5. **All:** Review README/AGENTS revisions next sync to confirm onboarding materials match the transparency roadmap.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Batch adjustments introduce conflicting writes when multiple facilitators act simultaneously. _Mitigation:_ Implement queued reconciliation with clear error toasts and add telemetry for conflict frequency.
- **Risk:** Player summaries could leak hidden enemy intel. _Mitigation:_ Enforce projection service redaction rules, add automated tests for faction/visibility edge cases, and document manual QA checklist.
- **Risk:** Mobile recap widgets may regress performance on low-end devices. _Mitigation:_ Prototype with virtualization and offline caching, run Lighthouse audits pre-release.

## Next Checkpoint
- Target follow-up sync on 2025-10-31 15:00 UTC to review batch adjustment progress, validate projection design, and sign off on player summary copy deck.
