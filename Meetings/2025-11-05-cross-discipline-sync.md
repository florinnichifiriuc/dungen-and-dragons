# 2025-11-05 Cross-Discipline Sync – Condition Transparency Roadmap

## Attendees
- Mira Patel – Product Owner / Facilitator
- Devon Ortiz – Lead Software Architect
- Lila Chen – Lead UI & Accessibility Designer
- Tomasz Gruber – Systems Engineer & DevOps
- Lark Everbright – Narrative & D&D Experience Lead
- Focus Group: Three veteran players from the Verdant Shards campaign, one new-to-D&D player from onboarding cohort

## Agenda
1. Celebrate wrap-up of Tasks 38–49 and validate telemetry rollout
2. Inspect gaps surfaced during share-link beta and mobile recap usage
3. Align on next ten transparency/accountability milestones
4. Capture focus group sentiment and risk mitigation items
5. Assign owners, dependencies, and success metrics for Tasks 50–59

## Discussion & Decisions
### What Went Well
- Escalation states in the timer dashboard now mirror the urgency rules from the tabletop reference sheet, which the focus group called "eerily faithful."
- Share links (Task 49) load in under 300 ms thanks to caching layered in Tasks 39 and 45; engineering kept the narrative copy hooks flexible for future localization.
- Mobile recap widgets (Task 40) met the accessibility checklists—focus group visually impaired participant highlighted the consistent heading structure.

### Issues & Risks
- Beta facilitators still screenshot the dashboard rather than using share links because expiry defaults feel aggressive; needs configurable settings (captured in Task 57).
- Analytics from Task 47 revealed burst traffic during recap uploads that spiked queue latency; DevOps to right-size worker autoscaling before push notifications (Task 50).
- Player digest copy leans heavily on urgent timers; narrative wants balanced tone so it does not feel punitive—requires new narrative review checkpoint (Task 51).

### Focus Group Feedback
- Veteran players appreciated acknowledgement trails but want optional "mentor tips" explaining why certain conditions recur; to explore in Task 58's AI briefings.
- New player requested a single "What changed since my last login?" digest combining timers, loot, and quests—requires cross-system aggregation (Task 51 dependency on Task 23 data feeds).
- Group agreed that offline recap caching saved their last in-person session when Wi-Fi dropped, yet they still lost queued acknowledgements; offline sync reliability prioritized in Task 54.

### Appreciations
- UI team praised for harmonizing urgency gradients across dashboard, mobile, and share views, reducing cognitive load.
- Engineering applauded for telemetry completeness: every timer adjustment now has an audit record, easing compliance review.

### Critiques
- Turn scheduler demo still buries condition deltas deep in narration; PO asked for highlight callouts in the automation script refresh (future backlog note outside Tasks 50–59).
- QA regression suite missed a bug where guest users on share links see stale acknowledgement counts; flagged as a test gap to be closed in Task 59.

### Architect & PO Alignment – Export Readiness
- Devon Ortiz (architect) requested that the export guide enumerate default retention expectations, webhook signing behavior, and download guardrails so integration partners cannot bypass consent gates when automating pulls.
- Mira Patel (PO) emphasized providing end-to-end examples—including facilitator UI states and webhook payloads—to help storytellers explain why certain timers are redacted when consent is missing.
- Both agreed to circulate the finalized export documentation and sample datasets to the compliance distribution list before wider beta invites go out.

## Decisions & Next Steps
- Ratified Task 50–59 scope with cross-discipline buy-in; sequencing to emphasize notification infrastructure before AI enhancements.
- Tomasz to draft autoscaling adjustments ahead of push messaging rollout (pre-work logged under Task 50).
- Lila to provide updated notification wireframes and empty-state illustrations by 2025-11-07 UTC (Task 50 dependency).
- Narrative team to co-write digest copy variants before sprint commit (Task 51).

## Action Items
- **Devon**: Document new config flags for share-link expiry (feeds Task 57) by 2025-11-06 18:00 UTC.
- **Tomasz**: Benchmark queue throughput during recap exports and share results in engineering channel by 2025-11-06 22:00 UTC.
- **Lila**: Deliver notification and digest wireframes covering desktop/mobile and light/dark themes.
- **Lark**: Draft AI briefing prompts for mentor tips, ensuring spoiler-safe variants, by 2025-11-08 12:00 UTC.

## Meeting Minutes
- **16:00 UTC:** Kickoff; reviewed telemetry dashboards confirming <1% error rate post Task 49 deployment.
- **16:10 UTC:** UI walkthrough; celebrated accessibility wins, noted need for notification wireframes.
- **16:20 UTC:** Systems deep-dive; identified queue saturation risk and aligned on autoscaling tweaks.
- **16:35 UTC:** Focus group feedback; recorded requests for mentor tips and digest tone adjustments.
- **16:50 UTC:** Roadmap planning; agreed on sequencing of Tasks 50–59 and owners.
- **17:00 UTC:** Close-out with action item review and documentation reminders.
