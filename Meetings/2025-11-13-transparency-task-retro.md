# Transparency Initiative Task Review – Cross-Discipline Retro
- **Date:** 2025-11-13 16:00 UTC
- **Facilitator:** Delivery Lead
- **Attendees & Roles:**
  - Product Owner – backlog curation and stakeholder liaison
  - Engineering Lead – implementation status and technical debt triage
  - QA Lead – validation coverage and regression monitoring
  - Narrative & AI Lead – mentor briefing tone, localization, and AI guardrails
  - Data & Telemetry Lead – analytics, consent audit trails, and KPI tracking
  - D&D Focus Group Coordinators – live-play insights and player sentiment

## Agenda
1. Walk through Tasks 1–63 deliverables to confirm acceptance and documentation coverage.
2. Identify cross-task patterns in condition transparency UX, telemetry, and offline support.
3. Surface lingering risks, tech debt, or knowledge gaps before expanding scope beyond transparency.
4. Align on retro-inspired improvements to feed into the next sprint planning session.

## Completion Review Highlights
- **Foundational Platform (Tasks 1–20):** Authentication, campaign/session scaffolding, tile maps, and realtime collaboration are fully shipped with Pest/Dusk coverage. Documentation remains current, but attendees flagged the need for a refreshed onboarding quickstart that references the latest Inertia flows.
- **Task Board, AI, and Search Enhancements (Tasks 21–37):** Kanban workflows, AI DM support, and global search are stable in production with telemetry verifying adoption. AI mentors now include audit logging, yet the team wants to consolidate AI prompt libraries to ease localization.
- **Condition Timer Transparency Core (Tasks 38–52):** Player-safe projections, mobile widgets, narrative copy decks, analytics, and wireframes are complete. Focus group feedback confirms the dashboards and alerts meet accessibility goals, though preset bundle UX (Task 61) must inherit these lessons.
- **Transparency Expansion & Stewardship (Tasks 53–63):** Share trail logging, expiry stewardship, facilitator insights, QA automation, and guest experience polish are on track post-11/12 sync updates. Remaining acceptance items center on share preset bundles, mentor moderation playback digests, and recap catch-up prompts tied to Tasks 58, 61, and 63.
- **Process & Documentation:** PROGRESS_LOG.md and task briefs are current through 2025-11-12. All meeting minutes captured to date align with roadmap adjustments, and demo automation remains healthy per CI telemetry.

## Decisions & Improvements
- Publish a **Transparency Initiative Completion Dossier** compiling architecture overviews, QA scripts, telemetry dashboards, and narrative assets for stakeholders by 2025-11-20.
- Convert recurring insights dashboards into a **shared Inertia component library** to accelerate upcoming non-transparency initiatives.
- Bundle AI mentor prompt variants into a **centralized localization manifest** to simplify future language drops and consistency reviews.
- Schedule a **knowledge transfer series** (2 sessions) for new engineers to cover condition timer architecture, share link governance, and telemetry pipelines.

## Action Items
1. **Engineering Lead (2025-11-15):** Draft outline and asset inventory for the Transparency Initiative Completion Dossier; attach to TASK_PLAN.md and share with stakeholders.
2. **QA Lead (2025-11-16):** Normalize the end-to-end QA scripts into reusable scenarios and update Tasks/Week 7/Task 59 with regression tagging guidance.
3. **Narrative & AI Lead (2025-11-18):** Produce consolidated AI mentor prompt manifest and file under `backend/resources/lang/en/transparency-ai.json` with documentation notes.
4. **Product Owner (2025-11-19):** Coordinate the knowledge transfer sessions, logging agendas in Meetings/ and updating PROGRESS_LOG.md upon completion.
5. **Data & Telemetry Lead (2025-11-20):** Extract consent audit KPIs into a recurring Looker dashboard and reference setup steps in Tasks/Week 7/Task 62.

## Risks & Watchpoints
- **Documentation Drift:** As we prepare the dossier, there is risk of duplicate truth sources. *Mitigation:* designate TASK_PLAN.md as authoritative and embed links instead of copying content.
- **AI Prompt Consistency:** Without a manifest, translation updates could diverge from approved tone. *Mitigation:* require narrative sign-off on any prompt additions via pull request template checklist.
- **Telemetry Load:** Consolidating dashboards may increase query volume. *Mitigation:* batch refresh windows and reuse existing caching strategies validated during Tasks 53–57.
- **New Team Onboarding:** Incoming engineers might miss historical context. *Mitigation:* ensure knowledge transfer recordings and slides are archived alongside meeting notes.

## Next Steps
- Reconvene on 2025-11-21 16:00 UTC to review dossier progress, confirm action item completion, and decide whether transparency scope can transition to maintenance mode.
