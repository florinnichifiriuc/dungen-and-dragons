# Transparency Beta Release Readiness Report

_Date:_ 2025-11-15
_Prepared by:_ QA & Transparency Leads

## Executive Summary
The transparency initiative is ready to graduate from beta. Automated coverage now exercises guest share journeys, offline acknowledgement reconciliation, preset stewardship, and mentor recap catch-up prompts. Load testing baselines remain within thresholds, and focus group tables signed off on the curated scenario library.

## Coverage Overview
- **Automated Tests:**
  - `tests/Feature/ConditionTransparencyJourneyTest.php` simulates share creation, guest views, offline acknowledgements, redaction, and audit trails.
  - `tests/Feature/ConditionTimerSummaryShareTest.php` covers preset bundles, extension metadata, redaction guardrails, and consent enforcement.
  - `tests/Feature/ConditionTimerAcknowledgementTest.php` validates queue hydration and analytics payloads.
- **Performance Harness:** `tests/performance/condition_transparency_load.js` exercises share viewing, acknowledgement posting, and expiry extension with k6 thresholds.
- **Manual QA:** Guided by `QA/transparency-regression-scenarios.md` with accessibility, localization, and privacy checkpoints.

## Telemetry & Monitoring
- Synthetic monitor `php artisan condition-transparency:ping` wired to incident channel; alarms tuned to 3-minute breach window.
- k6 thresholds align with New Relic dashboards (`http_req_duration{journey:*}`) for quick regression detection.
- Consent extension actor metrics surface inside facilitator insights and export feeds.

## Focus Group & Stakeholder Sign-off
- Focus group tables completed beta playtest forms on 2025-11-14 and confirmed preset bundles satisfied live session needs.
- Product Owner, QA Lead, and Compliance Liaison reviewed dossier updates and accepted transition to maintenance cadence.

## Outstanding Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Localization backlog for new mentor ritual prompts | Track via narrative backlog; reuse manifest workflow with vendor SLA.|
| Telemetry opt-out UX refinement | Scheduled with consent analytics maintenance (Task 68 follow-up). |

## Next Steps
1. Transition ongoing maintenance to cadence defined in `backend/docs/operations/transparency-maintenance-transition.md`.
2. Archive beta assets and recordings alongside knowledge transfer sessions.
3. Monitor synthetic metrics for two release cycles and tune thresholds if necessary.
