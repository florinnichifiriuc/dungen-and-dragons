# Task Plan

## Backlog
- [x] Demo enhancements & known issues brief so stakeholders have a current risk snapshot before the rehearsal (see `backend/docs/operations/demo-enhancements-known-issues.md`).
- [x] Solution setup & CLI catalog outlining environment prerequisites and available artisan/Vite commands (see `backend/docs/onboarding/solution-setup-and-cli.md`).
- [x] Site structure map aligning Laravel domains with Inertia/React entry points for demo navigation prep (see `backend/docs/architecture/site-structure.md`).
- [x] API Swagger documentation draft covering auth, campaign, group, and transparency routes for handoff (see `backend/docs/api/swagger-overview.md`).
- [x] Demo end-to-end rehearsal checklist covering manual Playwright cadence while CI automation is disabled (see `backend/docs/testing/demo-end-to-end-rehearsal-checklist.md`).
