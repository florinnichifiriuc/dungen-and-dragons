# Task 39 – Condition Timer Player Summaries

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Product & Narrative Design
**Dependencies:** Task 38

## Intent
Expose a read-only, lore-friendly summary of active condition timers to players so they understand looming effects without leaking GM-only information or disrupting surprise mechanics.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Define which timer details are safe for players and how to redact hidden factions or GM-only notes.
- [ ] Implement a player-facing panel (session workspace + optional shareable link) with responsive styling.
- [ ] Coordinate alert copy with narrative tone to keep the experience immersive.

## Notes
- Player view should update in realtime alongside GM adjustments but avoid showing exact rounds for hidden enemies unless flagged.
- Consider integrating with the session recap log for historical context.
- Ensure localization hooks exist for future translation work.

## Log
- 2025-10-27 20:20 UTC – Logged follow-up to extend timer visibility to players after batch tooling.
