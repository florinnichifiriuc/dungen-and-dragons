# Task 52 – Condition Timer Share Access Insights

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 50

## Intent
Augment share analytics with trend data so facilitators can understand how often guests return. Provide rolling seven-day view counts inside the manager controls and capture that snapshot for exports.

## Subtasks
- [x] Aggregate share access logs by day for the trailing week inside the share service.
- [x] Render the trend data within the share controls UI with clear copy highlighting spikes or lulls.
- [x] Extend exports and regression coverage to account for the new insight payloads.

## Notes
- Ensure aggregation respects UTC and includes days with zero visits.
- Keep UI lightweight – text-based summaries are sufficient for now.
- Tests should assert both aggregation correctness and manager payload shape.

## Log
- 2025-11-05 09:15 UTC – Planned access insight rollup and documentation touchpoints.
- 2025-11-05 13:45 UTC – Delivered seven-day trend aggregation, share control summaries, export updates, and feature tests.
