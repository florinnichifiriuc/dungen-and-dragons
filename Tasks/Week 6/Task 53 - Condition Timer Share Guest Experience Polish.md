# Task 53 – Condition Timer Share Guest Experience Polish

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering & Design
**Dependencies:** Task 49

## Intent
Refresh the guest-facing share page with narrative framing, staleness cues, and contact guidance so party members understand how current the outlook is and who to reach out to for clarifications.

## Subtasks
- [x] Add hero framing, last-updated callouts, and facilitator contact hints to the shared outlook page.
- [x] Ensure the layout adapts cleanly across mobile/desktop and keeps the recap widget contextual.
- [x] Reflect the refreshed guest experience in regression coverage and documentation artifacts.

## Notes
- Reuse existing summary metadata where possible to avoid redundant queries.
- Keep guest page copy immersive but spoiler-safe.
- Document the polish in the progress log and task brief once complete.
