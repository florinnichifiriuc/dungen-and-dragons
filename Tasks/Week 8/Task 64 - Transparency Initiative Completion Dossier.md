# Task 64 – Transparency Initiative Completion Dossier

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering Lead
**Dependencies:** Tasks 38–63, Meetings/2025-11-13-transparency-task-retro.md

## Intent
Assemble a stakeholder-ready dossier that curates the transparency initiative's architecture, QA assets, telemetry dashboards, and narrative collateral so executive sponsors and new contributors can grasp the full scope without hunting across disparate docs.

## Subtasks
- [x] Inventory final architecture diagrams, service docs, and cache/telemetry references from Tasks 38–63 into a shared outline.
- [x] Collect QA artifacts (automation indices, regression tags, manual scripts) and summarize verification coverage per surface.
- [x] Curate telemetry dashboard screenshots, KPI definitions, and consent audit summaries into the dossier narrative.
- [x] Embed links to narrative assets (copy decks, mentor prompts, localization guidelines) and annotate ownership for upkeep.
- [x] Publish dossier in `Docs/transparency-completion-dossier.md` with executive summary, table of contents, and maintenance playbook.
- [x] Circulate draft for PO/QA/Narrative sign-off and track feedback resolutions in the log.

## Notes
- Treat TASK_PLAN.md as the authoritative index; link to existing documents rather than duplicating large sections.
- Ensure timestamps follow UTC conventions and redacted assets remove personally identifiable player data.
- Coordinate with QA to surface regression tag legend introduced during the 2025-11-13 retro.
