# Task 69 – Transparency Engineering Onboarding Quickstart

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering Enablement Lead
**Dependencies:** Tasks 64, 67

## Intent
Publish a concise onboarding quickstart that guides incoming engineers through local setup, key transparency services, and the knowledge transfer assets so they can contribute within their first day.

## Subtasks
- [x] Audit existing onboarding notes and extract transparency-specific prerequisites.
- [x] Draft quickstart covering environment setup, critical services, and reference documentation.
- [x] Embed demo scripts and callouts to the knowledge transfer recordings for self-paced learners.
- [x] Circulate quickstart with engineering leads and incorporate feedback.
- [x] Link the guide from TASK_PLAN.md, PROGRESS_LOG.md, and the knowledge transfer documentation set.

## Notes
- Emphasize dependency installation steps that unblock Pest/Vite runs once Composer/npm packages are provisioned.
- Highlight transparency telemetry safety checks so contributors understand privacy guardrails early.
