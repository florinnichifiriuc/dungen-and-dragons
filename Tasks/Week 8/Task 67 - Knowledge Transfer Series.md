# Task 67 – Knowledge Transfer Series

**Status:** Not Started
**Owner:** Product Owner & Engineering Lead
**Dependencies:** Task 64, Meetings/2025-11-13-transparency-task-retro.md

## Intent
Host a two-part knowledge transfer program that onboards incoming engineers to the transparency initiative's architecture, governance, telemetry, and narrative principles so they can contribute without rehashing historical decisions.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Draft agendas for two 60-minute sessions covering architecture/service overview and governance/telemetry workflows.
- [ ] Coordinate scheduling with new engineer cohort, ensuring recordings and slides are planned for archival.
- [ ] Prepare presentation materials leveraging the dossier (Task 64) and component/prompt work (Tasks 65–66).
- [ ] Conduct sessions, capture Q&A, and collect attendee feedback surveys for continuous improvement.
- [ ] Archive recordings, slides, and notes under `Meetings/` with cross-links in PROGRESS_LOG.md and TASK_PLAN.md.
- [ ] Summarize follow-up action items and assign owners for any gaps discovered during sessions.

## Notes
- Ensure confidentiality guidelines are reiterated before sharing telemetry or compliance-sensitive details.
- Provide hands-on demos referencing the transparency dashboards and AI mentor tooling.
- Invite QA and Narrative leads to co-present on their respective workflows.

## Log
- 2025-11-13 18:40 UTC – Scheduled per retro action item; initial agenda draft started with PO/Engineering alignment.
