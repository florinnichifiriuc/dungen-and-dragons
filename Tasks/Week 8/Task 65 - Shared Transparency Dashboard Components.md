# Task 65 – Shared Transparency Dashboard Components

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Frontend Guild
**Dependencies:** Tasks 34, 35, 52, 62

## Intent
Generalize the transparency dashboards and widgets into an Inertia + shadcn/ui component library so future initiatives can reuse the condition timer insights without rebuilding layout, accessibility, or telemetry wiring.

## Subtasks
- [x] Audit existing transparency dashboards to identify reusable cards, list patterns, filters, and alert treatments.
- [x] Extract components into `backend/resources/js/Components/transparency/` with Storybook-style usage docs and TypeScript props.
- [x] Provide Tailwind theming tokens and CSS variables so themes beyond transparency can restyle components quickly.
- [x] Document expected telemetry events and props contract for each component, referencing analytics helpers from Task 44.
- [x] Publish integration guide in `Docs/frontend-components.md` and link from TASK_PLAN.md and the dossier (Task 64).

## Notes
- Maintain accessibility cues (ARIA labels, focus management) proven during transparency rollout.
- Keep copy variants externalized so localization manifest work (Task 66) can reuse the same keys.
- Coordinate with QA to ensure visual regression snapshots reflect the shared library outputs.
