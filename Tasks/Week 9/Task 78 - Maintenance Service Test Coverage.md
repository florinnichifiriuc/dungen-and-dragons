# Task 78 – Maintenance Service Test Coverage

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 72

## Intent
Guarantee the maintenance snapshot logic remains stable by covering edge cases around consent gaps, quiet-hour ratios, and attention queues.

## Subtasks
- [x] Add unit tests asserting snapshot attention reasons when consent is missing and quiet hours spike.
- [x] Verify attention queue only returns groups requiring follow-up.
- [x] Freeze time to keep calculations deterministic across UTC windows.

## Notes
- Tests rely on factories to emulate realistic access trails and consent logs.

## Log
- 2025-11-21 17:25 UTC – Added maintenance service unit suite validating snapshot ratios and queue filtering.
