# Task 72 – Condition Timer Share Maintenance Snapshot

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 57, Task 61

## Intent
Provide a consolidated maintenance snapshot that cross-references share health, consent posture, and quiet-hour telemetry so operations can triage transparency links proactively.

## Subtasks
- [x] Add share and access model scopes to simplify maintenance queries.
- [x] Implement `ConditionTimerShareMaintenanceService` to assemble attention signals.
- [x] Surface share state, consent gaps, and quiet-hour ratios in a normalized payload.

## Notes
- Snapshots rely on UTC windows so the output can be compared against existing transparency metrics.
- Consent data is constrained to player roles to prevent surfacing GM acknowledgements as blockers.

## Log
- 2025-11-21 16:10 UTC – Implemented maintenance service, share/access scopes, and snapshot payload wiring.
