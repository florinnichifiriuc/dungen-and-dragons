# Task 80 – Maintenance Digest Test Suite

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 75

## Intent
Add regression coverage around the maintenance digest job so log dispatching only occurs when attention is warranted.

## Subtasks
- [x] Spy on the logger to assert digest notices fire when consent gaps exist.
- [x] Confirm the job silently exits when the group cannot be found or no attention is required.
- [x] Freeze time to keep expiry windows deterministic.

## Notes
- Tests reuse maintenance service bindings to ensure job wiring matches production resolutions.

## Log
- 2025-11-21 17:45 UTC – Added digest job tests verifying log output and guard clauses.
