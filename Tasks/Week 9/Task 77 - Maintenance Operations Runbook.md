## Subtasks
- [x] Document snapshot sources, attention criteria, and interfaces in `backend/docs/operations/condition-timer-share-maintenance.md`.
- [x] Capture configuration guidance for tuning maintenance thresholds.
- [x] Reference job and command hooks so operations can wire alerts into Slack.

## Notes
- Documentation focuses on UTC conventions and shared semantics so future automation can reuse the same vocabulary.
