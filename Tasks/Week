# Task 9 – Modular Tile Maps

**Status:** In Progress
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 3, Task 7, Task 8
**Related Backlog Items:** Implement modular tile map system (tile templates, axial coordinates, map tile CRUD)

## Intent
Introduce a reusable tile library and hex map editor so dungeon masters can sketch regions with reusable terrain pieces. Tile templates should capture terrain and movement metadata, while map tiles pin those templates to axial coordinates on group maps. The initial editor can be form-based but must respect orientation rules and guard against duplicate placements.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Add database structures and models for maps, tile templates, and map tiles with axial coordinates.
- [ ] Implement policies and controllers for managing tile templates and region maps under group authorization.
- [ ] Provide Inertia forms to create/edit tile templates and maps plus a basic map inspector for tile CRUD.
- [ ] Cover happy-path and edge cases with Pest feature tests (placement uniqueness, template authorization, lock guards).
- [ ] Update planning docs and progress logs once complete.

## Notes
- Default maps should use hex grids; allow switching between pointy/flat orientations to future-proof editors.
- Prevent deleting templates that are still referenced by map tiles so existing boards stay intact.
- Axial coordinates must remain unique per map to avoid stacking conflicts; validate before insert.
- Locked tiles should only be editable by group owners to preserve finalized layouts.
