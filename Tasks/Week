# Task 23 – Session Rewards & Loot Ledger

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 6, Task 22

## Intent
Equip the session workspace with a shared ledger so parties can log treasure, experience awards, and narrative boons the moment they drop. The ledger should stay alongside attendance, notes, and recaps while feeding exports for future reference.

## Subtasks
- [x] Create reward persistence, validation, and policies for campaign members.
- [x] Add reward logging/removal endpoints and Inertia routes.
- [x] Layer a reward form and ledger timeline into the session workspace UI.
- [x] Update session exports (Markdown + PDF) to include the reward ledger.
- [x] Cover reward logging/moderation/export flows with Pest specs and refresh documentation.

## Notes
- Any campaign member with session access can log a reward; GMs retain moderation rights.
- Type badges (loot, experience, boon, note) help distinguish reward categories at a glance.
- Optional quantity, recipient, and notes fields keep party distribution transparent.

## Log
- 2025-10-24 15:10 UTC – Scoped reward ledger UX, moderation rules, and export touchpoints.
- 2025-10-24 17:55 UTC – Implemented ledger persistence, UI, exports, tests, and doc updates.
