# Task 99 – Quest Log AI Assistant

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Narrative Design & Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 19, Task 13

## Intent
Augment the quest log with AI support so facilitators can supply brief hooks that blossom into structured quest entries, objectives, and optional imagery prompts tailored to their campaign tone.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Embed an AI helper that drafts quest summaries, objectives, and rewards from short user prompts, leveraging existing campaign data where appropriate.
- [ ] Provide quick links to generate complementary imagery prompts for map tiles or NPC art via the a1111 integration when enabled.
- [ ] Add review checkpoints, including edit history or suggestion accept/reject flows, before AI-authored quests are published.
- [ ] Update quest management documentation with guidance on collaborating with the AI assistant.

## Notes
- Maintain parity between AI-authored quests and manual entries so reporting and progress tracking remain consistent.
- Include safeguards to prevent spoiler exposure for players without GM permissions.
- Capture telemetry on accepted vs. rejected AI suggestions to guide iterative prompt tuning.
