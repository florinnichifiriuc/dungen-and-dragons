# Task 96 – Region Settings Orientation and Fog Clarity

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Engineering & UX Writing
**Dependencies:** Task 24, Task 95

## Intent
Resolve confusion around region orientation controls and fog-of-war configuration by tightening data binding, exposing immediate previews, and layering inline guidance that explains how map layers interact.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Audit the orientation toggle and ensure changes propagate instantly to the map canvas and stored configuration.
- [ ] Add contextual helper text, tooltips, and examples that explain fog presets, reveal flows, and GM/player visibility impacts.
- [ ] Provide a live preview widget that reacts to base layer selections so facilitators can confirm orientation and fog states before saving.
- [ ] Update knowledge base entries and troubleshooting guides with step-by-step fog configuration scenarios.

## Notes
- Coordinate with Task 95 so orientation feedback appears consistently across the revamped canvas experience.
- Include analytics events that highlight where users hesitate or abandon fog settings to inform future improvements.
- Ensure localization coverage for new helper copy.

## Log
- 2025-11-26 09:55 UTC – Captured fog/orientation confusion feedback and queued remedial UX improvements.
