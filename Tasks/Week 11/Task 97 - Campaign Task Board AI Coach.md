# Task 97 – Campaign Task Board AI Coach

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Product & Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 12, Task 13

## Intent
Embed an AI coach into the campaign task board so facilitators can describe goals in plain language and receive structured task suggestions, workflow tips, and quick-start templates without leaving the page.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Add a help drawer or floating coach button that opens AI guidance contextualized to the active campaign task board.
- [ ] Provide prompt templates that translate short user ideas into backlog items, assignments, and due date recommendations.
- [ ] Capture analytics and thumbs-up/down feedback to improve prompt engineering and identify coaching gaps.
- [ ] Refresh campaign documentation with guidance on leveraging the AI coach for sprint planning.

## Notes
- Ensure the coach can reference existing campaign tasks to avoid duplicate suggestions.
- Coordinate with accessibility to keep the help drawer keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly.
- Consider optional summary exports so facilitators can share AI-generated plans with their groups.
