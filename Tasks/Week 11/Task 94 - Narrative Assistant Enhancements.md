# Task 94 – Narrative Assistant Enhancements

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering & Narrative
**Dependencies:** Tasks 12, 17, 19

## Intent
Answer campaign feedback requesting lighter-touch AI helpers by embedding idea panels on campaign, lore, and quest dashboards, providing pre-seeded prompts, and surfacing guidance so players know how to turn a few words into rich entries or boards.

## Subtasks
- [x] Add an AI helper to the campaign overview that explains the task board and can draft backlog items.
- [x] Surface AI prompts plus quick-start idea chips on the lore codex index so teams can generate entries from short phrases.
- [x] Do the same for the quest log, including emphasis on image prompt generation for map art.
- [x] Update documentation to mention where AI assistants now live and how Automatic1111 prompts are exposed.

## Notes
- Keep idea panels collapsible-friendly and aligned with existing Tailwind palette.
- Provide actions that respect existing policies—only managers should see task automation affordances.
- Encourage players to copy prompts for external image tools without embedding third-party dependencies.
