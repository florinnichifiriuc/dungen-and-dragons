# Task 98 – Lore Codex AI Authoring

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Narrative Design & Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 17, Task 18, Task 13

## Intent
Empower storytellers to spin up lore entries quickly by pairing curated starter templates with an AI authoring assistant that can expand bullet prompts into rich codex drafts.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Introduce a library of predefined lore entry templates covering NPCs, factions, locations, and artifacts.
- [ ] Add an AI drafting sidebar that accepts short prompts, references campaign context, and proposes editable lore entries.
- [ ] Provide diffing or highlight tools so facilitators can compare AI suggestions against manual edits before publishing.
- [ ] Update narrative guidelines to include best practices for reviewing and customizing AI-generated lore.

## Notes
- Ensure generated lore is clearly marked as draft until a facilitator confirms publication.
- Respect campaign privacy settings by limiting which data the AI assistant can surface in prompts.
- Coordinate with localization to confirm template copy can be translated alongside AI outputs.

## Log
