# Task 92 – Role Stewardship & Seed Admin

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** None

## Intent
Ensure facilitators immediately understand account roles by seeding an initial administrator, surfacing account roles in the product shell, and tightening the admin console guidance for managing party permissions.

## Subtasks
- [x] Create a database seeder that provisions an initial platform admin with documented credentials.
- [x] Highlight the signed-in user’s global role on the dashboard and link administrators to the role management console.
- [x] Refresh onboarding docs so teams know how to sign in with the seeded admin and adjust account roles.
- [x] Clarify the admin user roster UX copy so it reinforces how to promote/demote facilitators.

## Notes
- Seeded admin should be idempotent and safe to run in shared QA/demo environments.
- Avoid exposing plaintext passwords outside docs—use `.env` configuration or defaults suitable for local demos.
- Dashboard treatment must remain accessible in both light and dark themes.
