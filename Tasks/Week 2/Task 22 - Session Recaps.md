# Task 22 – Session Chronicle & Recap Log

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 6 (Session Workspace), Task 21 (Attendance Roster)

## Objective
Create a shared recap journal inside each session workspace so party members can document what transpired, highlight memorable moments, and compile post-game summaries that also flow into session exports.

## Deliverables
- Persistence for recap entries tied to sessions, campaigns, and authors.
- Policy-backed endpoints so members can publish and remove their recaps while GMs retain moderation powers.
- Inertia UI for writing recaps and browsing the running chronicle alongside attendance, notes, and dice logs.
- Export updates to include recaps in Markdown/PDF output for archival sharing.
- Automated feature tests covering recap creation, deletion, and export visibility rules.

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Add `session_recaps` migration, model, factory, and policy hooks.
- [x] Build store/destroy controller actions with validation and authorization.
- [x] Extend the session workspace UI with a recap form and timeline display.
- [x] Surface recaps through the export service and markdown output.
- [x] Add Pest feature coverage for recap flows and update docs/logs.
