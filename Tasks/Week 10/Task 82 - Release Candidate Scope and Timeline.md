# Task 82 – Release Candidate Scope and Timeline

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Product & Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 71, Task 81

## Intent
Define the final two-week release window, scope boundaries, and cross-team checkpoints so the transparency initiative can ship on schedule with clear expectations for QA, operations, and communications.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Lock release candidate scope, risk register, and contingency triggers with stakeholders.
- [ ] Map a two-week calendar covering QA freezes, regression suites, bug triage cadences, and launch rehearsals.
- [ ] Publish a unified timeline in the program hub and notify engineering, QA, narrative, and support partners.

## Notes
- Coordinate with support to align on expected player communications and escalation paths during the freeze.
- Ensure the timeline references required unit, integration, and end-to-end test gates before sign-off.
