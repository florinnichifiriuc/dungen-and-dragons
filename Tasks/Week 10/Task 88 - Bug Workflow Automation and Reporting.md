# Task 88 – Bug Workflow Automation and Reporting

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering & Support
**Dependencies:** Task 87

## Intent
Automate bug intake routing, notifications, and reporting so the admin platform stays actionable and leadership has real-time visibility into launch health.

## Subtasks
- [x] Configure notification pipelines for critical bugs (PagerDuty/Slack) and daily digests for broader status awareness.
- [x] Build analytics widgets summarizing bug volume, resolution time, and category trends inside the admin dashboard.
- [x] Document the escalation matrix and integrate it with the release timeline to ensure timely responses.

## Notes
- Reports should align with existing transparency KPIs to correlate bug trends with player impact.
- Ensure automation respects quiet hours and escalation policies defined in earlier tasks.
