**Status:** Planned

## Intent
Automate bug intake routing, notifications, and reporting so the admin platform stays actionable and leadership has real-time visibility into launch health.

## Subtasks

- [ ] Build analytics widgets summarizing bug volume, resolution time, and category trends inside the admin dashboard.
- [ ] Document the escalation matrix and integrate it with the release timeline to ensure timely responses.

## Notes
- Reports should align with existing transparency KPIs to correlate bug trends with player impact.
- Ensure automation respects quiet hours and escalation policies defined in earlier tasks.
