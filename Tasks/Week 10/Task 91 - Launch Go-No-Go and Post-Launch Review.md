# Task 91 – Launch Go/No-Go and Post-Launch Review

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Product, Engineering & QA
**Dependencies:** Task 82, Task 89, Task 90

## Intent
Run structured go/no-go checkpoints, track release metrics, and schedule post-launch retrospectives so the team can make informed launch decisions and capture lessons learned.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Conduct daily go/no-go huddles during the launch window reviewing test results, bug backlog, and monitoring dashboards.
- [ ] Document launch decision outcomes, approvals, and rollback triggers in the program hub.
- [ ] Schedule a post-launch retro to evaluate bug reporting efficacy, AI mock performance, and player satisfaction metrics.

## Notes
- Include QA sign-off that unit, integration, and end-to-end suites (with AI mocks) have passed before launch decisions.
- Capture metrics from the admin platform to inform the post-launch review.

## Log
- 2025-11-22 11:55 UTC – Drafted governance outline for launch decision checkpoints and retrospectives.
