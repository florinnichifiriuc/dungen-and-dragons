# Task 83 – AI Service Mocking and Test Harness

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 58, Task 78

## Intent
Provide deterministic AI service mocks for unit, feature, and end-to-end tests so the release candidate can validate AI-driven workflows without reaching live Ollama instances.

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement a Laravel service provider that swaps AI integrations with fixture-backed mocks during tests and local QA runs.
- [x] Add reusable mock factories covering mentor briefings, NPC prompts, and share summarization outputs.
- [x] Document the mocking strategy for engineers and QA, including guidance for extending fixtures as prompts evolve.

## Notes
- Mocks must cover HTTP clients and queue jobs to guarantee no outbound Ollama traffic executes in CI or automated tests.
- Coordinate with QA to ensure the mocks align with scenario scripts used in the end-to-end harness.

## Log
- 2025-11-22 09:45 UTC – Captured requirement to replace direct Ollama dependencies across all automated tests.
- 2025-11-23 11:20 UTC – Finalized mock fixture repository docs and verified AiMocksTest passes with deterministic mentor briefings.
