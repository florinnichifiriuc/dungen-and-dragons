# Task 89 – Release Monitoring and Rollback Readiness

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Engineering & Operations
**Dependencies:** Task 62, Task 88

## Intent
Establish monitoring dashboards, alert thresholds, and rollback procedures aligned with the bug reporting system so the team can detect regressions quickly and respond during the two-week launch runway.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Expand observability dashboards to include bug intake metrics, AI mock health checks, and end-to-end test pass rates.
- [ ] Script rollback runbooks for application, database, and queue changes with rehearsal checkpoints.
- [ ] Validate monitoring and rollback drills during launch rehearsals with sign-offs captured in program docs.

## Notes
- Ensure monitoring includes synthetic transactions that leverage AI mocks to mirror player journeys without external dependencies.
- Align rollback triggers with the risk register defined in the release candidate scope.

## Log
- 2025-11-22 11:25 UTC – Outlined monitoring and rollback expectations for the final release window.
