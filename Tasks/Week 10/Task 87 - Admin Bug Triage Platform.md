# Task 87 – Admin Bug Triage Platform

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering & Support
**Dependencies:** Task 52, Task 86

## Intent
Launch an admin dashboard for support and engineering leads to review bug submissions, assign owners, track status, and export reports so incidents can be addressed rapidly during the launch window.

## Subtasks
- [x] Build Inertia-powered admin pages for bug queues, detail views, and assignment workflows with role-based access control.
- [x] Integrate prioritization, tagging, and comment history synchronized with existing telemetry dashboards.
- [x] Provide export and notification hooks (Slack/email) for urgent regressions and daily summaries.

## Notes
- Ensure admin routes enforce multi-factor authentication per governance guidelines.
- Align UI components with the shared transparency component library for consistent styling.
