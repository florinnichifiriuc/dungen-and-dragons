# Task 10 – Milestone Demo Flow Automation

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Process update to require milestone demos
**Related Backlog Items:** Establish milestone demo flow automation that runs at a human reading pace with verbose console narration

## Objective
Implement a reusable console-driven milestone demo flow that surfaces the latest delivery highlights at a human reading cadence so each milestone review can be automated yet audience friendly.

## Deliverables
- Artisan command to run the milestone demo flow with verbose narration
- Configurable pacing so the flow can run at human reading speed during automation
- Ability to target the latest milestone, a specific milestone, or the whole history
- Documentation updates so the team knows how to run the flow
- Progress trackers updated with the new automation capability

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Parse milestone history from progress tracking sources
- [x] Render narrated console output with configurable pacing
- [x] Support filtering (latest, specific milestone, or full sequence)
- [x] Document usage in README and task trackers
- [x] Add automated coverage for the demo flow command
