# Task 16 – Accessibility, Localization & Theming Polish

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 6 (Session Workspace), Task 14 (Global Search)
**Related Backlog Items:** Finalize localization, accessibility, theming, and docs.

## Intent
Complete the first sprint accessibility and localization objectives so the platform supports multiple languages, adjustable appearance, and inclusive focus handling. Ship persistent user preferences for language, timezone, theme, font scale, and high-contrast outlines while updating the shared UI shell and documentation to reflect the enhancements.

## Subtasks
- [x] Draft accessibility/localization plan and capture acceptance criteria in this task file.
- [x] Add persistent user preference fields, middleware, and validation for locale, timezone, theme, contrast, and font scale.
- [x] Update the Inertia layout with translation support, skip links, theme toggles, and high-contrast focus states.
- [x] Build a dedicated accessibility & appearance settings page with localized copy and Pest coverage.
- [x] Refresh documentation and progress trackers to note the new capabilities.

## Notes
- Localization launches with English and Romanian; translation keys live under `resources/lang/{locale}/app.php`.
- User preferences default to system theme, dark/light options respect OS settings when applicable, and timezone changes propagate to PHP runtime configuration for consistent scheduling.
- High-contrast mode reinforces focus visibility with amber outlines that meet WCAG contrast ratios.

## Log
- 2025-10-21 08:40 UTC – Outlined preference schema, middleware hooks, translation needs, and accessibility targets.
- 2025-10-21 11:10 UTC – Implemented preference persistence, layout theming, localization utilities, settings UI, tests, and documentation updates.
