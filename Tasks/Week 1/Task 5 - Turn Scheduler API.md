# Task 5 – Turn Scheduler API

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering
**Dependencies:** Task 3, Task 4
**Related Backlog Items:** Develop turn scheduler service and API (process turn, AI fallback)

## Objective
Implement a region turn processing workflow that advances scheduled turns, records outcomes, and provides an AI-generated fallback summary when a human DM is unavailable.

## Deliverables
- Turn service capable of generating next-turn windows and persisting processed turns
- Region-facing endpoints and UI for initiating manual or AI-assisted turn processing
- Persistence for processed turns with attribution and scheduling metadata
- Pest unit/feature coverage plus Laravel Dusk journey for processing a turn via the UI
- Documentation and project trackers updated with progress

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Design migrations/models for turns and scheduler metadata
- [x] Expose turn processing controller + request validation with policies
- [x] Build Inertia UI for reviewing cadence and processing turns with AI fallback option
- [x] Add Pest feature/unit specs and Laravel Dusk coverage for turn processing
- [x] Update README and progress trackers
