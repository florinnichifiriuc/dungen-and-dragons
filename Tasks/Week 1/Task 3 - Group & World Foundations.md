# Task 3 – Group & World Foundations

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering  
**Dependencies:** Task 1, Task 2  
**Related Backlog Items:** Create group management (create/join/roles) and policies; Build world + region CRUD with configurable turn durations and DM assignments

## Objective
Implement baseline backend structures for groups, regions, and configurable turn schedules that underpin multi-campaign, multi-DM collaboration. Provide initial REST endpoints and frontend views for creating groups, assigning DMs to regions, and defining turn cadence (6h/24h configurable).

## Deliverables
- Database migrations for groups, group memberships, regions, and turn configurations.
- Eloquent models, policies, and controllers for CRUD operations.
- Turn scheduler service stub with configuration options.
- Inertia pages for group dashboards and region assignment forms (skeleton components).
- Updated documentation and progress log entries.

## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Design migrations and models for groups, memberships, regions, turn configs.
