# Task 56 – Condition Transparency Data Exports

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Engineering & Compliance
**Dependencies:** Tasks 41, 47, 48, 53

## Intent
Offer facilitators and administrators governed data export options (CSV/JSON and webhooks) for condition transparency artifacts. Ensure exports respect privacy filters, consent settings, and audit requirements while integrating with existing export infrastructure.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Define export schemas for timers, acknowledgements, chronicle history, and notification logs.
- [ ] Implement export request UI with queue-backed processing and email/slack confirmations.
- [ ] Add webhook subscription management with signed payloads and rate limits.
- [ ] Enforce governance policies (role checks, consent flags, retention windows) in export pipeline.
- [ ] Update documentation and developer guides with integration examples.
- [ ] Add automated tests for export filtering, webhook delivery, and governance enforcement.

## Notes
- Reuse session export styles where possible to maintain consistent UX.
- Coordinate with legal/compliance stakeholder on retention periods and redaction rules.
- Provide sample CSV/JSON fixtures for QA and partner integrations.
