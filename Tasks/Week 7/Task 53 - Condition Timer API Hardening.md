# Task 53 – Condition Timer API Hardening

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Engineering & DevOps
**Dependencies:** Tasks 35, 38, 47

## Intent
Strengthen the condition timer APIs to handle burst updates, conflicting edits, and malicious retries while maintaining responsive UX. Introduce defensive patterns, observability, and resilience playbooks to protect facilitator trust during the beta scale-up.

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement per-entity rate limiting and exponential backoff guidance for clients.
- [x] Add optimistic concurrency guards with deterministic reconciliation messaging.
- [x] Extend telemetry dashboards with circuit breaker alerts and anomaly detection on timer adjustments.
- [x] Perform chaos testing scenarios (delayed queues, stale caches) and document recovery steps.
- [x] Update Form Requests and policies with clearer error messaging for multi-select adjustments.
- [x] Expand automated tests covering race conditions, retries, and queue drain handling.

## Notes
- Coordinate with Task 50 to ensure notification dispatch respects new rate limits.
- Provide troubleshooting runbooks for support and DM moderators.
- Keep failure copy in-world but precise, e.g., "The weave shuddered—try again after a breath." 

## Log
- 2025-11-05 16:55 UTC – Logged after identifying queue saturation risk during meeting review.
- 2025-11-08 09:40 UTC – Shipped token/map rate limits with narrative backoff, circuit breaker cooldown, chaos testing playbook, translated error copy, and regression coverage.
