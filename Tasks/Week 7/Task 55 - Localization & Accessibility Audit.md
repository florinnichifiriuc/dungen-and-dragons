# Task 55 – Localization & Accessibility Audit

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** UI & QA
**Dependencies:** Tasks 40, 41, 45, 50

## Intent
Validate that all condition transparency surfaces—notifications, digests, dashboards, and share links—meet localization and accessibility standards. Ensure new content is translation-ready, screen-reader navigable, and color-contrast compliant across themes.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Inventory new UI strings and route them through localization pipeline with context notes.
- [ ] Conduct accessibility audit (WCAG 2.2 AA) on notification center, digests, and analytics dashboards.
- [ ] Update keyboard navigation maps and focus management for new interactive components.
- [ ] Provide translation fallback testing (e.g., pseudo-localization) to catch layout regressions.
- [ ] Expand automated accessibility checks in CI and document manual QA checklist updates.
- [ ] Coordinate with narrative to validate tone across localized strings.

## Notes
- Ensure urgency gradients remain distinguishable for color-blind users; revisit palette if necessary.
- Provide transcripts for any audio cues introduced in notifications.
- Track accessibility findings in shared QA board for accountability.

## Log
- 2025-11-05 16:59 UTC – Scheduled to keep parity with earlier accessibility commitments as new flows emerge.
