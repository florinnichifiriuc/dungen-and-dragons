# Task 59 – End-to-End Transparency QA Suite

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** QA & Engineering
**Dependencies:** Tasks 50–58

## Intent
Establish a comprehensive QA suite and beta acceptance checklist covering guest share links, notifications, digests, analytics, and offline recovery so the transparency initiative can graduate from beta with confidence.

## Subtasks
- [x] Expand automated regression journeys simulating guest access, acknowledgement loops, expired share scenarios, and recap-feed catch-up prompts for missed mentor briefings.
- [x] Add load/performance scripts for notification dispatch, digest generation, and export queues that replay focus group encounter pacing logs.
- [x] Document manual QA checklist with accessibility, localization, privacy verification steps, and AI moderation queue review workflow.
- [x] Normalize reusable scenario library with regression tagging guidance for dossiers, dashboards, and onboarding references.
- [x] Integrate synthetic monitoring for share links and notification endpoints with alerting thresholds tuned to focus group cadence.
- [x] Coordinate with focus group for structured beta acceptance playtest, capturing qualitative feedback and signed commitment forms.
- [x] Produce release readiness report summarizing coverage, open risks, mitigation plans, and consent auditor sign-off on extension trails.

## Notes
- Ensure QA artifacts align with compliance expectations and audit requirements.
- Reproduce previously reported guest acknowledgement count bug to validate fix.
- Provide timeline for regression suite execution in CI/CD to prevent drift.
- Leverage Task 61 preset bundle definitions to seed scenario matrices for expiry + visibility permutations.
