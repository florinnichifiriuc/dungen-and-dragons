# Task 59 – End-to-End Transparency QA Suite

**Status:** In Progress
**Owner:** QA & Engineering
**Dependencies:** Tasks 50–58

## Intent
Establish a comprehensive QA suite and beta acceptance checklist covering guest share links, notifications, digests, analytics, and offline recovery so the transparency initiative can graduate from beta with confidence.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Expand automated regression journeys simulating guest access, acknowledgement loops, and expired share scenarios.
- [ ] Add load/performance scripts for notification dispatch, digest generation, and export queues.
- [ ] Document manual QA checklist with accessibility, localization, and privacy verification steps.
- [ ] Integrate synthetic monitoring for share links and notification endpoints with alerting thresholds.
- [ ] Coordinate with focus group for structured beta acceptance playtest, capturing qualitative feedback.
- [ ] Produce release readiness report summarizing coverage, open risks, and mitigation plans.

## Notes
- Ensure QA artifacts align with compliance expectations and audit requirements.
- Reproduce previously reported guest acknowledgement count bug to validate fix.
- Provide timeline for regression suite execution in CI/CD to prevent drift.
