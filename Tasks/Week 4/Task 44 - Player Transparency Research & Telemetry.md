# Task 44 – Player Transparency Research & Telemetry

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Product & Analytics
**Dependencies:** Task 39

## Intent
Establish qualitative and quantitative feedback loops to evaluate how player-visible condition summaries affect trust, immersion, and decision-making so we can iterate quickly after launch.

## Subtasks
- [x] Define research brief covering target cohorts, interview scripts, and player trust/immersion survey questions.
- [x] Instrument analytics events for summary views, interactions, and dismissal reasons with privacy-safe metadata.
- [x] Draft rollout success metrics (engagement, retention, satisfaction) and reporting cadence for the leadership dashboard.
- [x] Coordinate with QA to capture edge cases requiring manual verification during beta (e.g., hidden faction reveals).

## Notes
- Ensure analytics respect existing privacy policies and avoid storing sensitive narrative content.
- Include plan for A/B testing narrative copy variants once enough data accumulates.
- Document how telemetry hooks integrate with existing Laravel event broadcasting and queue systems.
