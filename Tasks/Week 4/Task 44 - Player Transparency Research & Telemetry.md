# Task 44 – Player Transparency Research & Telemetry

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Product & Analytics
**Dependencies:** Task 39

## Intent
Establish qualitative and quantitative feedback loops to evaluate how player-visible condition summaries affect trust, immersion, and decision-making so we can iterate quickly after launch.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Define research brief covering target cohorts, interview scripts, and player trust/immersion survey questions.
- [ ] Instrument analytics events for summary views, interactions, and dismissal reasons with privacy-safe metadata.
- [ ] Draft rollout success metrics (engagement, retention, satisfaction) and reporting cadence for the leadership dashboard.
- [ ] Coordinate with QA to capture edge cases requiring manual verification during beta (e.g., hidden faction reveals).

## Notes
- Ensure analytics respect existing privacy policies and avoid storing sensitive narrative content.
- Include plan for A/B testing narrative copy variants once enough data accumulates.
- Document how telemetry hooks integrate with existing Laravel event broadcasting and queue systems.

## Log
- 2025-10-28 10:10 UTC – Added to measure impact of transparency features and inform follow-up iterations.
