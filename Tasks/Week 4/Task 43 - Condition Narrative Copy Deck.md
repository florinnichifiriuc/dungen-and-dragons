# Task 43 – Condition Narrative Copy Deck

**Status:** Completed
**Owner:** Narrative Design
**Dependencies:** Task 39

## Intent
Author reusable, lore-friendly narrative snippets that explain active conditions, impending expirations, and resolution events so player-facing summaries remain immersive while respecting secrecy constraints.

## Subtasks
- [x] Draft copy variants for the top 12–15 conditions across urgency tiers (calm, warning, critical) with redaction guidance for hidden factions.
- [x] Collaborate with localization to capture tone notes, character limits, and pluralization requirements.
- [x] Validate copy against gameplay scenarios with the D&D Experience Lead and iterate on phrasing for clarity versus mystery.
- [x] Produce QA checklist covering spelling, spoiler prevention, and localization placeholders for engineering handoff.

## Notes
- Ensure copy can surface without exact round counts when hidden enemies are involved; emphasize sensory cues over mechanics.
- Include optional flavor hooks for AI-driven summaries to expand upon when Gemma3 is invoked.
- Maintain alignment with accessibility guidance (avoid idioms that translate poorly, provide gender-neutral language).
