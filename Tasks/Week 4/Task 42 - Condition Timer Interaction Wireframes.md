# Task 42 – Condition Timer Interaction Wireframes

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** UI/Frontend
**Dependencies:** Task 38

## Intent
Provide high-fidelity wireframes and interaction notes that capture how batch adjustments, player summaries, and mobile recap widgets should behave across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints before engineering begins implementation.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Audit existing dashboard and session layouts to map insertion points for batch controls and player panels.
- [ ] Produce annotated wireframes for desktop, tablet, and mobile, covering empty, loading, conflict, and success states.
- [ ] Define component handoff notes (Tailwind tokens, shadcn primitives, motion guidance) and focus order expectations.
- [ ] Review prototypes with D&D Experience Lead to ensure thematic alignment and gather copy/layout feedback.

## Notes
- Include gesture guidance for mobile (swipe to select, long-press actions) and fallback patterns when gestures are unavailable.
- Document accessibility considerations (focus traps, screen reader labels, contrast ratios) alongside each frame.
- Capture responsive behavior for banners/toasts so success and error states remain visible without occluding gameplay.
