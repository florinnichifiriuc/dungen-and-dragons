# Task 41 – Timer Projection Developer Guide

**Status:** Planned
**Owner:** Engineering Enablement
**Dependencies:** Task 39

## Intent
Document the reusable projection/service pattern introduced for player-safe timer summaries so future features can leverage the same approach without duplicating logic.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Capture architecture overview (data flow, caching strategy, invalidation triggers) in `/backend/docs` including failure telemetry expectations.
- [ ] Provide code samples covering projection creation, broadcast usage, and testing guidelines.
- [ ] Update onboarding docs to reference new projection utilities and relevant Form Requests.
- [ ] Coordinate with QA to list new test cases required for projections.
- [ ] Document integration points for analytics events defined in Task 44 and narrative copy hooks from Task 43.

## Notes
- Emphasize privacy boundaries between GM and player payloads.
- Highlight failure modes (stale cache, broadcast miss) and mitigation tactics.
- Align doc styling with existing engineering handbook conventions.
- Include checklist references for Tasks 38–40 to keep implementation and docs in sync.
- Capture expectations for adding future projection consumers (mobile apps, exports).
