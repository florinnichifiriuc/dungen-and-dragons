# Condition Transparency Completion Dossier

_Last updated: 2025-11-15_

## Executive Summary
The transparency initiative (Tasks 38â€“66) is production-ready. Facilitators can share consent-aware outlooks, track access history, surface AI mentor briefings, and export telemetry with localized narrative copy. Player experiences now include freshness cues, catch-up prompts, and responsive layouts across devices.

## Architecture Highlights
- **Projection Services:** `App/Services/ConditionTimerSummaryProjector`, `ConditionTimerSummaryShareService`, and `ConditionMentorBriefingService` orchestrate timer payloads, share links, and AI briefings.
- **Manifest-Driven AI:** `ConditionMentorPromptManifest` powers localized mentor prompts (`resources/lang/*/transparency-ai.json`).
- **Shared Components:** Transparency dashboards reuse `InsightCard` and `InsightList` (`resources/js/components/transparency/`).
- **Telemetry & Exports:** `ConditionTransparencyExportService` bundles share trails, insights, acknowledgements, and chronicle data for CSV/JSON delivery with webhook notifications.

## QA Assets
- **Automated Tests:** Pest coverage spans share links (`tests/Feature/ConditionTimerSummaryShareTest.php`), mentor briefings (`tests/Unit/ConditionMentorBriefingServiceTest.php`), moderation (`tests/Feature/ConditionMentorModerationTest.php`), digests (`tests/Feature/PlayerDigestTest.php`), and share service exports.
- **Load Testing:** `tests/performance/condition_transparency_load.js` provides k6 baselines for shared outlook latency.
- **Regression Tags:** Refer to `QA/condition-transparency-beta-readiness.md` for scenario alignment.

## Telemetry & Insights
- Share access insights (Task 62) aggregate seven-night trends, bundle adoption, and extension actors for facilitator dashboards and exports.
- Player digests now include mentor catch-up prompts sourced from moderation-approved briefings.
- Access trails log anonymized actor metadata, bundle selections, and monitoring outcomes for compliance audits.

## Consent Analytics & Alerting
- Looker Consent Audit KPI dashboard (`backend/docs/operations/consent-audit-kpi-dashboard.md`) tracks acknowledgement freshness, expiry overrides, extension actor mix, and revocations.
- Alert thresholds and PagerDuty workflows live in `backend/docs/operations/consent-telemetry-alerting-playbook.md` with facilitator/compliance messaging templates.
- Dashboard embeds respect facilitator SSO; maintenance cadence reviews thresholds quarterly per the transition plan.

## Narrative & Localization
- Mentor prompts localize via the manifest, preserving spoiler-safe tone and moderation notes.
- Shared outlooks include freshness cues (`share_view.staleness.*`) and guest etiquette guidance.
- Romanian locale mirrors English copy for share controls, insights, and mentor prompts.

## Knowledge Transfer & Onboarding
- Session 1 (architecture/services) and Session 2 (governance/telemetry) agendas plus recordings documented in `backend/docs/knowledge-transfer/` and `Meetings/2025-11-18-knowledge-transfer-architecture.md` / `Meetings/2025-11-19-knowledge-transfer-governance.md`.
- Quickstart guide (`backend/docs/onboarding/transparency-engineering-quickstart.md`) lists environment setup steps, essential commands, and first-week checklist.
- Feedback template captures survey responses and action items for future cohorts.

## Maintenance Playbook
1. **Dependencies:** Run `composer install` and `npm install` before executing Pest and Vite tasks.
2. **Migrations:** Execute `php artisan migrate` to apply moderation columns and share preset keys.
3. **Testing:** `php artisan test` (Pest), `npm run lint`, and optional `npm run build` for TypeScript validation.
4. **Telemetry Review:** Inspect `storage/logs/laravel.log` for `condition_timer_share_access_recorded` events when validating access flows.
5. **Localization Updates:** Sync manifest changes across locales and regenerate translated strings where necessary.

## Transition Plan
- Ownership roster, cadences, and transition backlog outlined in `backend/docs/operations/transparency-maintenance-transition.md`.
- Consent telemetry alert drills scheduled monthly; governance reviews quarterly with compliance oversight.
- Enhancement requests funnel through maintenance backlog triage during bi-weekly syncs.

## Sign-Off Checklist
- [ ] Facilitator dashboard displays share insights and mentor moderation queue without console warnings.
- [ ] Shared outlook renders freshness cues, catch-up prompts, and respects consent redactions.
- [ ] Exports include insights payloads and download successfully in CSV/JSON.
- [ ] AI mentor briefings respect manifest tone, moderation, and localization expectations.
- [ ] Player digests deliver mentor catch-up summaries and condition highlights per user preferences.

Once these checks pass, notify PO/QA/Narrative stakeholders and archive sign-off notes alongside this dossier.
