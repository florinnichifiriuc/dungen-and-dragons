## Executive Summary
The transparency initiative (Tasks 38–71) is production-ready and positioned for long-term stewardship. Facilitators can publish consent-aware outlooks, review access trails, extend expirations, and export telemetry with localized narrative copy. Players benefit from freshness cues, catch-up prompts, and responsive layouts across devices while AI mentor briefings reinforce preparedness without revealing spoilers.

## Architecture Inventory
- **Projection & Share Services:** `App/Services/ConditionTimerSummaryProjector`, `ConditionTimerSummaryShareService`, and `ConditionMentorBriefingService` coordinate timer payload assembly, sharing, and AI briefings. Data flow and cache invalidation notes live in `backend/docs/projections/condition-timer-summary-projection-guide.md`.
- **Preset & Access Stewardship:** Share presets, expiry management, and audit logging are configured through `config/condition-transparency.php`, with persistence defined in `database/migrations/2025_11_07_093000_add_preset_key_to_condition_timer_summary_shares_table.php` and documented in the Task 60–63 briefs.
- **Shared UI Components:** Transparency dashboards reuse `InsightCard` and `InsightList` (`resources/js/components/transparency/`) with guidance in `backend/docs/frontend-components.md`, including the analytics wiring (`recordAnalyticsEventSync`) and CSS token overrides future surfaces can adopt without restyling from scratch.
- **Telemetry & Export Services:** `ConditionTransparencyExportService` and related jobs feed CSV/JSON exports, webhook notifications, and consent compliance archives. Export pipeline details and governance guardrails are maintained in `backend/docs/operations/condition-transparency-data-exports.md`.

## QA Coverage & Verification
- **Automated Tests:** Pest suites span share links (`tests/Feature/ConditionTimerSummaryShareTest.php`), mentor briefings (`tests/Unit/ConditionMentorBriefingServiceTest.php`), moderation (`tests/Feature/ConditionMentorModerationTest.php`), digests (`tests/Feature/PlayerDigestTest.php`), and regression journeys (`tests/Feature/ConditionTransparencyJourneyTest.php`).
- **Load & Synthetic Monitoring:** `tests/performance/condition_transparency_load.js` exercises k6 baselines, while `artisan transparency:monitor` (Task 61) underpins nightly synthetic checks documented in `QA/transparency-regression-scenarios.md`.
- **Regression Tag Legend:** Scenario coverage, manual scripts, and beta readiness notes remain centralized in `QA/condition-transparency-beta-readiness.md` and the release readiness report at `QA/transparency-release-readiness-report.md`.
- **Acceptance & Sign-Off:** Manual verification checklists for facilitator dashboards, guest outlook polish, and exports are tracked in the Task 59–63 briefs and cross-linked from `Tasks/Week 7` documentation.

## Telemetry Dashboards & KPI Definitions
- **Consent Audit KPIs:** The Looker dashboard outlined in `backend/docs/operations/consent-audit-kpi-dashboard.md` measures acknowledgement freshness, expiry overrides, bundle adoption, and revocations. KPI definitions align with governance expectations captured during the 2025-11-13 retro.
- **Alerting & Incident Response:** Thresholds, PagerDuty rotations, and communication templates are codified in `backend/docs/operations/consent-telemetry-alerting-playbook.md`. Monthly drills ensure facilitators and compliance stakeholders stay prepared.
- **Share Insights & Trends:** Facilitator dashboards surface seven-night adoption trends, extension actors, and bundle performance using the shared transparency components. Export schemas for these metrics are detailed in `backend/docs/operations/condition-transparency-data-exports.md`.

## Narrative & Localization Collateral
- **Mentor Prompt Manifest:** `backend/docs/ai-mentor-prompts.md` and the localized manifest (`resources/lang/*/transparency-ai.json`) preserve spoiler-safe tone, moderation notes, and translation workflows introduced in Task 66.
- **Transparency Copy Deck:** Narrative guidelines, localization guardrails, and ownership annotations live in `backend/docs/narrative/condition-timer-copy-deck.md`, ensuring updates retain consistent voice.
- **Guest Experience Copy:** Shared outlooks reference localized strings under `resources/lang/*/share_view.*` for freshness cues, etiquette guidance, and extension messaging aligned with Task 63 deliverables.

## Knowledge Transfer & Onboarding
- **Session Materials:** Architecture and governance session agendas plus recordings reside in `backend/docs/knowledge-transfer/` alongside meeting summaries (`Meetings/2025-11-18-knowledge-transfer-architecture.md`, `Meetings/2025-11-19-knowledge-transfer-governance.md`).
- **Engineering Quickstart:** `backend/docs/onboarding/transparency-engineering-quickstart.md` lists environment setup, essential commands, and a first-week checklist. Cohort feedback is tracked via the survey template within the same directory.
- **Mentor Briefing Walkthroughs:** Facilitator-focused video notes and moderation workflows are linked from `backend/docs/ai-mentor-prompts.md` for quick reference during onboarding.

## Maintenance Playbook
1. **Dependencies:** Run `composer install` and `npm install` before executing Pest, Vite, or Reverb commands.
2. **Migrations:** Apply new schema updates with `php artisan migrate`, including preset bundles and moderation columns added during Tasks 60–63.
3. **Testing:** Use `php artisan test` for Pest coverage, `npm run lint` for TypeScript + accessibility checks, and `npm run build` for release smoke validation.
4. **Telemetry Review:** Inspect `storage/logs/laravel.log` for `condition_timer_share_access_recorded` and related events when validating access flows, and confirm Grafana/Looker alerts remain healthy.
5. **Localization Updates:** Sync manifest changes across locales, regenerate translated JSON resources, and coordinate with narrative for tone validation.

## Transition Plan
- Ownership roster, cadences, and transition backlog are detailed in `backend/docs/operations/transparency-maintenance-transition.md` with quarterly governance checkpoints.
- Consent telemetry alert drills occur monthly; backlog triage and enhancement planning happen during the bi-weekly transparency maintenance sync.
- Any deviations or escalations should be logged in `Meetings/` notes and referenced from the maintenance backlog to preserve institutional memory.
